    "# What is a programming language? What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a set of instructions, telling the computer what to do. In the end, it's just a bunch of 1s and 0s. In order to write programs and keep track of them and debug them easily, we write in programming languages, which are then translated into 1s and 0s. (This process is sometimes known as interpretation and sometimes compilation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been around for more than 30 years. It's now super super popular. Why? Python is a perfect language for an age in which people are expensive and computers are cheap. If we can increase the person's productivity in writing code, then that's worth having to pay more for computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is popular in a wide variety of areas:\n",
    "- Data science and machine learning (#1)\n",
    "- Web development\n",
    "- Devops and system administration\n",
    "- Automated testing\n",
    "- Education\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is super consistent -- once you learn something in the language, you can use it forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "I sometimes call Python the Esperanto of programming languages, because it is so consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter gives us the illusion that we're running Python in the browser. There's a server on the back end that's actually running Python -- but it's a great illusion! I can type into it, and give you text (Markdown) or in code (Python)."
