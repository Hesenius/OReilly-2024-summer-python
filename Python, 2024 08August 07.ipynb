    "DRY (don't repeat yourself) rule says: Only write code once, if you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we have several lines in a row that are roughly the same, then we can turn them into a loop.\n",
    "2. If we have the same code in several different places in our program, then we can use a function to write the code once and execute it multiple times.\n",
    "3. If we have the same code in several different *programs*, then we can put it in a *library*, and refer to it multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we call our libraries \"modules\" and \"packages.\" A module actually does two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It provides us with library functionality, so that we don't have to rewrite the same code or reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "2. It also provides us with namespacing, ensuring that we don't have namespace collisions, where variables collide.\n",

    "Python doesn't really have constants, aka names that are permanently attached to values, but it's traditional to call variables with ALL CAPS NAMES \"constants,\" and to avoid resetting them. Many times, a module will contain one or more constants that we are welcome to use, but aren't supposed to modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you encounter a module, you should ask yourself what definitions it brings to the table. Usually, all of the functionality in a module will be related."

    "2. The argument that we give to `import` is the name of the module variable we want to define.\n",
    "3. We don't provide, in Python, the filename or path from which `import` should read. That is implicit. The name of the module variable and the name of the module file are the same (more or less). In the above `import random`, we're saying that we want to load the `random.py` module that Python will know how to find."
