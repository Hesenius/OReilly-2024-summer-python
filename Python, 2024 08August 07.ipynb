    "1. If we have several lines in a row that are roughly the same, then we can turn them into a loop.\n",
    "2. If we have the same code in several different places in our program, then we can use a function to write the code once and execute it multiple times.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, we call our libraries \"modules\" and \"packages.\" A module actually does two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It provides us with library functionality, so that we don't have to rewrite the same code or reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "2. It also provides us with namespacing, ensuring that we don't have namespace collisions, where variables collide.\n",

The name of the module variable and the name of the module file are the same (more or less).
